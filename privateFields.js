//Use Private Fields and Getters
//Define a BankAccount class with:

// private field #balance

//A constructor that takes an initial balance

//A method deposit(amount) that adds to the balance

//A method withdraw(amount) that subtracts from the balance (but only if thereâ€™s enough money)

//A getter balance that returns the current balance

class BankAccount {
  #balance;
  constructor(initbalance) {
    this.#balance = initbalance;

    if (amount <= this.#balance) {
      this.#balance = this.#balance - amount;
